<p>The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] 
    is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial 
    carnivore. </p>

<p>The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,
    [13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] 
    The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over 
    millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17]</p>
